# network-science-crash-course
This repository contains a crash course on network science using the networkx Python package.
Before providing an overview of the questions we will be answering as part of this crash course, I want to recommend an excellent introduction to graph theory for those of you who might be interested in understanding more nuances and facets of this beautiful topic:

In this crash course, we will be addressing questions such as
* How to properly define a graph (undirected or directed)? How to add nodes (with specific characteristics) and edges (with specific characteristics)?
* How to compute and visualize basic statistics at the node (e.g., degree) or edge level?
* How to compute shortest paths in a network?

and we will do so by relying on the networkx (https://networkx.org/) Python package, that is specifically designed to generate built-in or ad-hoc networks and compute a plethora of features, indicators, indices according to the specific need of the user.
